        <h1>This page presents three interconnected texts, all gathered under the emerging notion of untitlement. A term not yet coined in full, untitlement gestures toward the gray zone between “Untitled” and “Disentitlement,” pointing to the differing ways in which humans and machines relate to language. Readers are invited to explore this distinction over the course of approximately one hour and thirteen minutes. The first two parts bring the spotlight onto the last hope of russian underground—Leonid Kotelnikov, also known as Fake Trailers, offering him space to speak freely and at length. Please note that first two issues are meant to be in Russian, but Leonid insisted on the machine translation, as it would only add to the conversation.</h1>
        <p>TL;DR? Just close this page.</p>

        <h2>Issue 1: interview</h2>
        <div class="container grid">
        <h3>The reader should also be aware of the interview’s setting: it took place on a Sunday late afternoon  after Rewire Festival, in a typical sports bar — the kind one might find in any European city center — where four people gathered to say their goodbyes and, at the same time, interview Leonid. The conversation was recorded on a phone, with a football match playing above us on TV, and as the evening progressed and the consumed alcohol per visitor increased, so did the noise of its patrons. That atmosphere — the unfiltered soundscape of voices, languages, and distractions — is fully present in the audio. And the text? The recording was later given to state-of-the-art transcription tools, which struggled to separate speech from noise, especially given the bar’s international crowd. Machines attempts produced mostly gibberish, which was then handed over to the latest AI models to extract meaning — a task at which they successfully failed. And yet, Leonid’s voice, thoughts, and sense persist. An effort towards meaning is added via [...] by the interviewer, but careful reader will not even need these clarifications. Topics discussed include his recent journey through the Balkans, beginning with a pregnant dog near a Transnistrian mineshaft, then following the Danube into Romania. From there, the conversation drifts into photography and his time with Mihai Barabancea, eventually leading to reflections on contemporary photography, music, literature and eventually to the act of namegiving. Enjoy the read.</h3>

            <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Leonid? Are we writing an interview now?</p>  </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes... so, for some show, like <em>Talents of Ukraine</em>... only, in my opinion,         from the American wing. There was a guy who claimed he had a talent for reading books. There was immediately, of course,         an uproar and interest. What did it all look like? I'll give you an example: a table like this one, in front of us in this bar. And he says he's going to read everything quickly in front of him. It looked like this:         he just flips through the book and at the same time into the microphone lapel, which I'm connecting now, says: "Like this         so         here" [<i>Leonid's speech speeds up to unimaginable amounts of words per second; here and further notes in             square brackets - note. interviewer</i>] That's it. Basically, that's how I can briefly tell you how I ended up in         Transnistria...</p>  </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: It will be very interesting to hear.</p>  </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: In short... The mines of Transnistria. I thought they were abandoned, but they turned out to be operational. And there I am.         But the guard didn't notice me as I slipped into the territory. I was coming back and he was at the <em>crowd</em>. And         there was an entrance         to the mine. I approached and looked: not such a hole like in the gateways. So I looked closely: can I crawl in or not? And then         from the hole, a <em>pregnant dog</em> crawls out. I'm kind of cringing from this, but I understand: if she could crawl through,         then for sure         I must somehow crawl through. But at that moment, I was <em>connection-dish-lantern</em> and there was some guy; we started in         camaraderie and it turns out he made some kind of <em>specialty-coffee</em> on the territory of this mine.     In the disclosure of the mines, it's really working, that you crawl in there. Thankfully, to endure already not what     was not once. Cotri targeting, перепыры, вот и достаточно приятное общение.</p>      <p>And he doesn't charge money for the coffee he made. So he talks about the fact that he now travels to         <em>Transnistria</em>. I wanted to say that I would like to see this and that there... Yes, how, in short, I got         the impression that he is a very nice person and that we can end up there together.     </p>      <p>Recently, he said over the phone: he would go tomorrow         and could accompany me to <em>Transnistria</em>, because, you understand, it will be dangerous to go alone.         For which he asked for about ten times more money than the bus trip. I didn't quite understand. I wouldn't have crawled with the mines, but it all looks really scary.</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:         Was it that hidden treasure of the Soviet Union? That nuclear bunker near the border?</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: No, a working mine is a really dangerous         topic. And the MK-workers there just drank this devilish metal.</p>  </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:         Which mine are we talking about? The one in the city?</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>:         No-no! There... About the mine - there is some extraction still happening. It's really serious. And it's a pain in the ass to try to sneak in here because the guard is tied to you. Well, two         hours in Transnistria, it's generally shkot.</p> </div>   <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:         And what was there? </p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>:         Shkotovy! You're going... I can't. Yes! Northern Karia! Of course! Whatever         you want!</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Yes</p> </div>   <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes. In Atsapre-Dniesteria. You pass the northernmost         water. Transfer to the border. This is where the cars with the Moldovans [<i>moldovans</i>] are located and there everything is         <em>maximum</em>. Moldovan plus you         Russian. Absolutely withdrawn.         You just want to see something. They don't fuck you up, they don't pay attention to what you're driving. I'm filming         on something like and evenly. All, about 5 minutes on the territory.</p>      <p>In Short, We Live there, EVERYTHING There is Generally Maximallly Devoid of Light. </p> </div>   <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So, I am basically interested in another question about casting...</p> </div>   <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: There are several castes: there are well-to-do people who are employed in some simply factory premises, because they can be robbed.          You can rob what is left there from previous times; this is the coolest. That is, it's like, I don't know: here <i>[In the Netherlands]</i> whoever is in a Ferrari with a negative top.         it means you're driving as if nothing happened. Darkness enters the full cycle of Chevoliva.</p>      <p>I'm still a wonderful playlist; I pumped up to listen... There are shamans and various other good         performers of song dances. And then we ended up, accordingly, in the Bender district, the pentagon near the Pradia; there we         got out of         the car. I looked over the fence at the cemetery, which is located around this so-called         pentagon. I saw the charts, there is just <em>stepped tea berry</em>, because without the Mardens and two         boats were taken, and it was just convenient for people to walk there. That's how they walked and stepped, no need. People were just         standing on the way in the forest, and then got back in the car.</p>      <p>OH, I ALSO PASSED by the COPS, It's A Mess.      </p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: and no problems with the Transnistrian militia? </p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: We passed, yes, everything is maximally easy, just showed these papers,         which         they gave us there. That's it. We saw a lot there, from the window, some shit. That is, there, let's say, some there         right in the center of Bender. That is, the very center of the city, you can see that people have <em>aliexpress charged during the day             devices</em>, because at that moment it turns off by the деревьерин. And then you already have to poke around. This         looks quite interesting because with the skin вот         it's a very bright but small лучсеза окон. Well, these are the Transnistrian adventures. </p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Good. And what about other legacies of civilization? For example, wells?</p>  </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Listen, I don't know specifically about this. I haven't spent enough time there to consider         цептокс and дину ютальтия. But I suppose that there are no special problems with this; the problems are in the Narva matter or the caster.     </p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So the water supply system is not related to this electricity?</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: In any new place I've been to — there has always been a way to get water. And         few people want to fall into the city just to have a simple <em>skonalization</em>; more often they dig a pit, and         everything is removed from the house into one pit. Then I dragged it, that with oxygen I dragged.</p>  </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I have an uncle, for example, he has a special relationship with the city. He built himself a house         so that the power plant pays him money every month for giving energy back to the grid. There are solar panels,         a small fan, he even dug himself a tunnel underground for a thermodynamic turbine.</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes, someone good! I'm a salonist too with a quoted one. And the dream with her already brings cedar drus;         cedar and the ground — you haven't hit yet. Mm... actually the end.         Draw here. Right in the summer with attitlifem. In Romania, I Inv Pho. Pure saturation... Oh! Just по трагамер         делку. Cool books! And in general, very         cool dude [<i>Mihai Brabaneșcu</i>]. I was blown away; there everything was just sapalo. So, everything started with my little girlfriend         — a transushka in Lada — who initially lived for a long time in the Netherlands. And she hinted me my primary steps in Amsterdam: what you need to do is come to Kabia and in Kabia         look for a transushka in Lada. There really is the first... as he gave me the mazic thanks to... they opened up! In short,         otherwise         Mihai comes to us; I also wrote him into the same place where I was myself. The transushkas owned him, he understands that this         is the only place where he was the only time in         silence 5 years ago. He made a fuss, acid, and threw chairs out the window. Then he had a book presentation,         which a person came to, who, in fact, was the owner of this place. They         made some kind of reconciliation. Mihai explained to him that he was a native there and all that. Please         forgive me for this curiosity as a viewer.</p>      <p>There’s a cool photo: exactly at the moment when I passed in a set in games without a dirty handover of keys to Mikhail         [Mihai]. Someone photographed us — some builders. Bombastic nonsense! But just you... Some teacher from a printer         climbed out, in short. Not a Moldovan! I was also asked about something in Moldova. Unlike this loaded one with the most managed Europe, there is         one “gaza” [<i>Tomato Gose - a unique Russian beer with vegetables</i>]. That is, it’s almost not in “gaza”. That’s it... Well, a newspaper for beer, like oh... I’ve already been in Russia for years, spread out. And I just wish         an incredible thing and I         am amazed.</p>      <p>I am Amazed. </p>      <p>I believe that these are the Netherlands [Niderlandy] and tomato gose should be connected from childhood. Here are three people — this is         some kind of foodie and         a business idea because “gaza” is an idea to take from the line. Here’s also for the company, a dude with Alty, a fat dude with         Alty. That’s it. Here’s also from what         I cursed everything. It was poor here. Good “gazaya”, hop-hat-brewery, and in Ukraine everything is “rustremy”. A bottle, with         “rustrem”, tomato         kuza, I dream of all this. </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:         And tomatoes, where are they grown here?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>:         On solar panels. On solar panels. On solar panels. On solar panels. On solar panels.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So, okay... </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: well you know, при дистрове здесь знаешь малдол... </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Let's move on. Romania. This... What is it even? What are the impressions?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: travelblog now, right? We are not very complicated; it's just that I was there Prokrasci and in general here.         I would like to see Puharest once, but Puharest did not leave me with a good impression. I think,         that it's more of a hole; but there actually are some topics about the view.</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I also don't feel much difference.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Oh, how is it? No, I think it will be a sigans. It's like a tabora and dances - what we         see. I really like everything around the circle-poki and all sorts of         small villages. It's not very difficult to promote. Here's a stupid example, one day - what about the krumuni? We go to different         places that we want to see with my friends: igram and rumuns. And it means that with the baby... who is 3         months old due to his mother's relationship with         what in him... At the moment, it turns out that it doesn't correspond to the program of our desires. And the guys         realize that my program is mainly to expand somehow - and this is impossible to do         with a baby. Accordingly, I'm good with it. I just get out, and here is a garnolyl resort,         a huge dog, such an <em>allobai</em>. Approaches me, and I say to him: "Hello, hello! I'm fine. I'll find you about         here and in the north. This is <em>game-kva-del</em>, and you and I have a 20-hour hellish kaip through 20 times one by one in         another place — once nakhti of abandoned mines, zhulkers on the mountains and with other things under the konsovka. This is these winter, that is         there... But sometimes you squeeze out for sure that in Robbo such, then they are higher for you than calm. But I am in     beyders for economy. This is easy, but you with drink and in LON, and you can taste like with vorkh. Mostly, that in     some moment we are completely fiercely cold. Naturally, no one has transport communication with nothing. Cars do not accumulate and     cool dudes — rumurintsy, pityuki, whom I met for right.</p>      <p>We just take you where you need. In the course of their initial plans were generally the opposite: I’ll throw off the car — that’s it! Don hotel,         where         my friends settled — half an hour and dizdy. We chat awesomely on different topics while driving. And at some         moment I also say something about cops. Hateful! I show so that they are all cops. But the guys are paying —         which is surprising! If you compare with Pridnestrovian or Kazakhstani for Rukhoy — here how could you bring it         missed. The fattest! </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: What places have been visited?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes, everything you want has been — we want to ask! They told me about one word here —         tonnelit... So I got to know one dream — I tonnelit! Sumna has its own experiment. Here or,         replies? I have a girlfriend who writes to me that she         is a professional in caves. And she led the tunnel, in short, just cars through the mountain. And she wrote: "How I love         caves". What now is under question at all, what she understands.</p>      <p>In general, I wanted to leave when from Gorselexperienz it was somewhere, something I better, somehow there. And more to         there, something on <em>grofomalenkoye</em>. Something like that, you lick and remove all the handunia. Here's this snob in         obrunni for you.</p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: And if you just briefly say about Romania?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: What pleases me there is         to be introduced in the villages and in the close natural mountain areas. </p>      <p>And Such a Friend Serves in a Bibrostochno Lenienthon Way, Exhales to Serve for Sobushkom to look at              </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: It will be interesting to listen.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: I can imagine how it was... damn! It's just fucked up. Semre specters kaspilizii.         How not to umasyu... you would just see! Just that it пораживОчным —         pokemoniders like Plate regardless ranks and longer likami. I can look at what it was.</p>      <p>And You Didn’t Pustal from Bedonsk? </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: No! In the store everything is so amazing! </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: There, on the contrary, from the cancer estrancy in the stores — bigan         razek: there are sandwiches and bigan various salads... buly! There is anything! There is makuetno... but exactly this         ... Blyatya! This is generally traditional olikrasos.</p>  </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Sorry, well, I said it.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Zhuk and t <em>symbolic</em> not something? Yes, and therefore when there is g         <em>Krankenku</em>, then I now ask <em>obviously right here dropping</em>. Is there which KO! Yes, no, not         that, almost he once in Magov, here in Maliksi-Verebuzhku. Yes,         because there it also skovorits, behind the ear stands a cross, and on it they have some kind of story from         <em>miblia</em>, but         just in the symbol.     </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So there is a snake, a skull, a hip and a head — well or something like that. But the story, everywhere different;         they very rarely repeat. How in five symbols to tell biblical stories?.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: And like that — silence; if the set came. What is there? What is there? Something or there. And         byal-to gostoronnny уже from you and cannot. I traveled very little; I did not by tishineov undressed points that I saw         to watch. And I         had one trip by car, where I was in the direct place of probulmkiry right from the wires. I would also on the beard beer would         beat and... And there is also beer. Petka looked; there, probably,         the road to the fight. Aaa!</p>     <p> In Short Yes - I Just Like that Actually Effects         </p> </div>  <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Well what? There is not?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: And in the hall? Well and the door in the hydern? What is it? I do not reka, do not reka. What? No? What         is there? Well just some kind of food there,         what is station. But it also does not come for teln. Ah, by-takoichikam, it is convenient for you, for you the smell is really.         Yes, by-takoichikam, I so not by smell.     </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Give me lom</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Statistically mgn already NerWell. <em>Gundam Andy</em>.

And I, of course, constantly was teasing different         akringums from data on amazing paper in underdrawing covers, but which in essence are cheap         imitation of <em>Rayon Loginle</em>. And all this, that is Zhaba, Teri and Recherson of our reality.         Now         quite little. For me mostly, as I see, now amuse <em>autoselfists</em> from film         products,         although film products are not-vegan, because still are used gelatin containing products for         projections. That is, photos, under which I often get — not by running. Why am I apologizing to you         lordgodmy?     <p><em>Ye</em>[<i>Kanye West</i>] — gave a very good interview.

That, which as an answer can         be used — this is my kind of attempt to understand on a happy         selfin. He met still in ancient times; there were people who photographed exclusively some selfin. And at         the remarkable publishing house Infinity Press recently came out... incredibly strong pattural perbersion, which lives         in trage somewhere on the territory         of Britain. All his photography and everything is connected only with himself. That is, he puts a tripod and photographs himself. This         very much conveys some kind of vitality of the process. Here to all the so-called bomgua photography.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: just like moving pictures, like paik, who talks about the honesty of what we feel.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: it seems to me that this is already a bit irrelevant. and it doesn't work from oneself; it rather works only for oneself. there is a certain schizophrenic quality in it. in everything i say — more schizophasia. and that's why on video... i put on demka, kukul, strankl and pake an amazing person from the city... damn... igor govman from kantak and tuchka ros. he has a channel on youtube; there is a wonderful discussion there about russian and punishment — something about lami...</p>      <p>the first voluminous city. </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I was in Kherson. </p> </div> <div class="speech">  <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: I was only in Kiev. I can't throw myself in to continue these  psychotherapy sessions of our  interview. My day in Kiev, what does it look like? So you wake up early in the morning and you wake up in an apartment,  where...         are now writing denunciations about you, that you're Russian and you should die.</p> <p>He's just an anti-fascist.      <p>At that point, he's just an anti-fanatic spokesman, and you explain to him that you're going to visit the most  right-wing of Kivalya Ukraine in the evening. And he says, "That's fine," because a lot of his colleagues also go there  to listen to  <em>black vitriol</em>.     </p>       <p>You understand that everything is fine; </p>      <p>I highly suggest that all podcast readers pay close attention to this interview with a surname from pesnoir, telling  about  the delights of France and my authoress's hatred of France. The lines and mujina we discussed today  and fucked up French assholes have nothing  to do with the fact that actually something everywhere can always be <em>good</em>. And familiars are very much  telling the front of a certain redneck way of life, when in some small  town there is some completely parallel <em>France</em>. Unfamiliar to the average person who is ustret  near  the Paris Tower. Something called. There's Damdy Paris. Noter Damdy Paris.</p> </div> <div class="speech">  <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Let it be Noterdam de Paris.</p> </div> <div class="speech">  <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Okay, it will be Noter Damdy Paris. Any, I had it there. Well, it's the same. Well, not an Elgusian tower. But some Notre Dame Paris. No, which one?</p> </div> <div class="speech">  <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: The Eiffel Tower.</p> </div> <div class="speech">  <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Eiffel? Yes. Barizheis, the elven tower. </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Well, in my opinion, Eiffel, ayfol-tallor.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Ah, ayfol, ayfol! That's it, I accepted.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I was also confused for a second. I really like how you are conducting this interview. I'm even         interested in where you will lead it next?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: I apologize for the fact that I am conducting it because I feel like I am in the forest to my own         aircentism. And I feel like this on ACK crossrage consport. I will not use... I don't remember... I wanted         to use the expression of sick-mochey from the Heniku group... But this word flew away to the north; it faces         creates support because your         fluids say that I'm doing the right thing and it encourages me more to kindle.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Chuver to pugle, let's say... what did you expect, Leonid?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Let's be pischurat! You are interesting to the rainbow and you put me! I was filming the second         clip, specially ordered a positive attachment for the GoPro 360 camera.         When I ordered it, I didn't know that renting it for one day costs as much as buying it. It was a big         mistake. What was the task of this attachment?</p>     <p>I Performed in the City of Tula, If I Remember Correctly.  </p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Yes, of course. How did the city accept you?</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: The combat task was some dunes close to the city of Tulla, where he was filmed as a common array for the         second clip. It is interesting how the story about why I touch my head like this - more precisely, not why, but how it         happens and what it means to me. I asked for attention to the fact that when I record an answer to someone's         questions... And what if it wasn't here yet? I must bring my right hand to my         the back of my head, including the roof. And at some point, realizing that I constantly use this technique - apparently leading me away from some kind of         nervous tension - I began to circle my hand around my head.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Yes, yes.</p> </div> <div class="speech">     <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: And it is noticeable from the hairstyle that there is a little no hair on the top of the head. This is some kind of phenomenon. I         used         this when we performed in Paris; me and another sritsya. I used glue that I was sure I could         wash off easily with water. About         <em>Pontagon gem</em> there was a situation in Berlin. When I used ladox glue on my eyes, I thought it was impossible to remove it, and partially cut off my hair on my head. Later I learned that it can be easily removed with warm         water.         So it happened, that's why not so many hairs were lost.     </p>      <p>But then, when I Performed in a Pair with Another Person, and then in a setting with a client, i noted that I Had Another Latex on My Hair - This Time Transparent. </p>      <p>This is a Moment to go work on the text. </p> </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="essay"> <p>Trains no longer “choo-choo”, yet we still do. In our collective imagination, electro-locomotive doesn’t sound much different from its steam ancestor from a hundred years ago. A borrowed name for sound that represents the root cause of the machine lives in us, echoing its origin in the collective imagination. Somehow, it stuck to a Western passerby, who heard the first steam engine run, acclaimed this human will over tons of steel, and coined its complexity into the simplicity of a sound that it makes. Something that moved, burned, screamed, and insisted on presence. This “choo-choo” marks the beginning of an era when a semi-autonomous mechanism was heard by us, and we invited its speech into ours. In a very similar manner to how toddlers (who are also semi-autonomous before a certain age) unwrap their language from babble into an established speech, we are now, a century later, witnessing a physical establishment of our collective subconsciousness in the form of a ChatGPT. Another machine, imitating speech. To trace back its root access to language, I might even argue that “choo-choo” was not an onomatopoeic moment; it was a borrowing moment — but I wouldn’t. In any way, a machine spoke to us convincingly of what it does and what it is, to which we listened carefully and noted it down. Now we are worried whether the evolvement of the techno will convince us to do stupid things, as its speech apparatus goes from opportunistic gibberisherian noises of steam leaving the nozzle to academic essays written in a split of a second.</p>  <p>And under the hood, it always was and still is a wood-fired stove that heats water, meanwhile the supply chain behind it has grown. Yet it still hasn’t broken free from the chains of some fuel-heating-water device. We just put it on steroids by making a turbine revolve from tons of evaporating water heated via a controlled nuclear fission chain reaction. A spectacle of excess, overlooking how it arrived at the dead end of categorization. And now we are at this very promising (by Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI) moment — that by means of evolving language inside a machine, we can find access to new horizons of science, moving towards giving up excessive water-boiling technology.</p>  <p>On the pathway towards it, we decided to teach the machine how to draw. And graphic design, suddenly, is facing a very interesting time. An automation time. Let us consider a designer, chained by metaphysical anxiety with a brewing deep inside them sense of losing a job, while seeing a website design being assembled on a screen in one prompt, interrupted by a question from AI, that takes a brief pause from its labour: “What’s going to be the URL for this website?” And when the tremble is almost gone, in hands reaching towards the keyboard, there is already another machine waiting to break free, in a Shrek-like motion, slamming somebody's laboratory door where further experimentation with language is being held to solve problems. Problems, problems, problems — when are we going to have them all solved, so all these start-ups with two-syllable names will nihiliate themselves? According to, almost speculative, calculations… We can assume that a syllable in English consists of an onset, a vowel nucleus, and a coda. Based on phonotactic analysis of the English language, there are approximately ninety possible syllable onsets, which include single consonants, two-consonant clusters, three-consonant clusters, and the possibility of no onset at all. For the vowel nucleus, English has about sixteen distinct vowel sounds, including both monophthongs and diphthongs. As for codas, there are around twenty-one possibilities, including twenty distinct final consonant clusters and the option of having no coda. When combining these parts, we get approximately twenty-six thousand unique syllables that conform to English phonotactic rules. If we then consider all possible two-syllable combinations — where any legal syllable may be followed by any other — the number of potential two-syllable words is the square of the total number of syllables. Squaring twenty-six thousand results in approximately six hundred seventy-six million possible two-syllable word combinations. This figure represents the upper bound of phonotactically legal, pronounceable two-syllable forms in English, regardless of whether they correspond to real or meaningful words. Do we really have enough problems in the world for all those yet-to-be-established start-ups?</p>  <p>The number of stars we can see at once varies, it is not that easily identifiable. We first have to experience them. Location, altitude, eyesight, weather, and local light pollution will take part. In a city, we might see fewer than a few dozen stars. In a rural area with minimal light pollution, maybe a few thousand. Conditions in the polar regions of the globe are often more inviting to look at stars, as the night spans for a couple of months. And there must’ve been once a Yakut on this earth, marching through the crisp snow of Taiga, whose pace would gradually decrease, bringing him down on his back to look and listen to the stars as they “whisper” to him. And there must’ve been a poet next to him, with whom, yet unfrozen, he tried to share what he heard — and maybe this was the moment when “whisper of stars” made it into Yakutian to refer to the dead-freezing-cold. Someone who is charmed by Western romanticism would have to tear down a series of barriers before reaching, in their imagination, a state of understanding in which the first Yakuts found themselves when they heard what the stars had to say to them. So much is embedded in that ultimate understanding of the very cold weather in just two words — isn’t it fantastic? Who would’ve cared that water molecules coming out of our lungs crystallize almost instantly, making whispering sounds as they collide and fall down, once the temperature goes below fifty degrees Celsius — there is a very convincing poetry of the landscape unravelling here, when someone who hears it for the first time takes a pause to process all that embodiment in just two words: “whisper of stars.” I bet it instantly clicked with the first person who heard it from that poet, for the poet spoke from his experience of being beyond something untitled. It is empirical truth, not because stars can speak, but because language can expand in motions far more complex than juggling syllables, and — paradoxically — language appears to be more precise than science.</p>  <p>So we stand between two acts of naming: one in response to the machine's scream, the other to the sky's whisper. Both are irreducible. Both speak of how meaning is not made through logic, but pressure. The Yakut and a Western engineer both arrived at the naming thresholds — moments when experience overflowed its content. Let us now consider another designer drawing an interface for navigating a ballistic missile. Nuclear. Something stupidly powerful, able to bring an end for many, and for sure. The choice of a dot to represent the hit target region is asking to be chosen. It’s here, ecstatically spasming, reaching towards the designer out of their toolbox of borrowed meanings, for its spotlight moment. It is an excess of clarity, both for those sending and those receiving a missile. A square would be an absolutely aesthetic option meant for pleasing the back of generals’ heads with shaved hairlines. And the designer here, knowingly or not, appears in a similar situation as Yakut poets and Western engineers: between things that demand names and those that refuse them. This is where it all starts — with the desire to name, for it never begins with theory, nor with function, and absolutely not with billions of books absorbed inside AI’s blackbox. It starts with an attempt to grasp the entity itself, before it becomes trapped in grids of concepts. Perhaps design is not about making objects conveniently usable, but about creating modes of perception itself, for things to be named. That anticipation of excessiveness was in the moment when the first man came across the notion that called for its name. So much of muchness concentrated in one point that it had to spill out into language and ask for a name for itself. With language being both motivated as a train running down the tracks and arbitrary as speaking stars, we still have hope for freedom from serfdom to techno as long as we are able to sense The Untitled — and the machine is bamboozled by the paradoxical nature of the language that we taught it. And while the machine’s speech apparatus, even the one available to the public, is already far superior to what a human can produce, The Untitled is still out there existing non-exhausted, and this is where I take a wild bet — that we are long before an AI will have its true “choo-choo” moment. Echoes of meaning that resist formal classification are on our side, together with The Untitled reaching out for our experience preceding categorization, throwing wrenches in the cogs of progress. All I hope for is that when an archi-ultra-super-intelligent AI emerges, it won't be so annoyed by our language too much that it decides to eliminate us instead of double-syllable start-ups.</p> </div>
