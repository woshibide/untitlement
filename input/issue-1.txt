    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Leonid? Are we writing an interview now?</p>

</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes... so, for some show, like <em>Talents of Ukraine</em>... only, in my opinion,
        from the American wing. There was a guy who claimed he had a talent for reading books. There was immediately, of course,
        an uproar and interest. What did it all look like? I'll give you an example: a table like this one, in front of us in this bar. And he says he's going to read everything quickly in front of him. It looked like this:
        he just flips through the book and at the same time into the microphone lapel, which I'm connecting now, says: "Like this
        so
        here" [<i>Leonid's speech speeds up to unimaginable amounts of words per second; here and further notes in
            square brackets - note. interviewer</i>] That's it. Basically, that's how I can briefly tell you how I ended up in
        Transnistria...</p>

</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: It will be very interesting to hear.</p>

</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: In short... The mines of Transnistria. I thought they were abandoned, but they turned out to be operational. And there I am.
        But the guard didn't notice me as I slipped into the territory. I was coming back and he was at the <em>crowd</em>. And
        there was an entrance
        to the mine. I approached and looked: not such a hole like in the gateways. So I looked closely: can I crawl in or not? And then
        from the hole, a <em>pregnant dog</em> crawls out. I'm kind of cringing from this, but I understand: if she could crawl through,
        then for sure
        I must somehow crawl through. But at that moment, I was <em>connection-dish-lantern</em> and there was some guy; we started in
        camaraderie and it turns out he made some kind of <em>specialty-coffee</em> on the territory of this mine.
    In the disclosure of the mines, it's really working, that you crawl in there. Thankfully, to endure already not what
    was not once. Cotri targeting, перепыры, вот и достаточно приятное общение.</p>

    <p>And he doesn't charge money for the coffee he made. So he talks about the fact that he now travels to
        <em>Transnistria</em>. I wanted to say that I would like to see this and that there... Yes, how, in short, I got
        the impression that he is a very nice person and that we can end up there together.
    </p>

    <p>Recently, he said over the phone: he would go tomorrow
        and could accompany me to <em>Transnistria</em>, because, you understand, it will be dangerous to go alone.
        For which he asked for about ten times more money than the bus trip. I didn't quite understand. I wouldn't have crawled with the mines, but it all looks really scary.</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:
        Was it that hidden treasure of the Soviet Union? That nuclear bunker near the border?</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: No, a working mine is a really dangerous
        topic. And the MK-workers there just drank this devilish metal.</p>

</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:
        Which mine are we talking about? The one in the city?</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>:
        No-no! There... About the mine - there is some extraction still happening. It's really serious. And it's a pain in the ass to try to sneak in here because the guard is tied to you. Well, two
        hours in Transnistria, it's generally shkot.</p>
</div>


<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:
        And what was there? </p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>:
        Shkotovy! You're going... I can't. Yes! Northern Karia! Of course! Whatever
        you want!</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Yes</p>
</div>


<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes. In Atsapre-Dniesteria. You pass the northernmost
        water. Transfer to the border. This is where the cars with the Moldovans [<i>moldovans</i>] are located and there everything is
        <em>maximum</em>. Moldovan plus you
        Russian. Absolutely withdrawn.
        You just want to see something. They don't fuck you up, they don't pay attention to what you're driving. I'm filming
        on something like and evenly. All, about 5 minutes on the territory.</p>

    <p>In Short, We Live there, EVERYTHING There is Generally Maximallly Devoid of Light. </p>
</div>


<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So, I am basically interested in another question about casting...</p>
</div>


<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: There are several castes: there are well-to-do people who are employed in some simply factory premises, because they can be robbed.

        You can rob what is left there from previous times; this is the coolest. That is, it's like, I don't know: here <i>[In the Netherlands]</i> whoever is in a Ferrari with a negative top.
        it means you're driving as if nothing happened. Darkness enters the full cycle of Chevoliva.</p>

    <p>I'm still a wonderful playlist; I pumped up to listen... There are shamans and various other good
        performers of song dances. And then we ended up, accordingly, in the Bender district, the pentagon near the Pradia; there we
        got out of
        the car. I looked over the fence at the cemetery, which is located around this so-called
        pentagon. I saw the charts, there is just <em>stepped tea berry</em>, because without the Mardens and two
        boats were taken, and it was just convenient for people to walk there. That's how they walked and stepped, no need. People were just
        standing on the way in the forest, and then got back in the car.</p>

    <p>OH, I ALSO PASSED by the COPS, It's A Mess. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: and no problems with the Transnistrian militia? </p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: We passed, yes, everything is maximally easy, just showed these papers,
        which
        they gave us there. That's it. We saw a lot there, from the window, some shit. That is, there, let's say, some there
        right in the center of Bender. That is, the very center of the city, you can see that people have <em>aliexpress charged during the day
            devices</em>, because at that moment it turns off by the деревьерин. And then you already have to poke around. This
        looks quite interesting because with the skin вот
        it's a very bright but small лучсеза окон. Well, these are the Transnistrian adventures. </p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Good. And what about other legacies of civilization? For example, wells?</p>

</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Listen, I don't know specifically about this. I haven't spent enough time there to consider
        цептокс and дину ютальтия. But I suppose that there are no special problems with this; the problems are in the Narva matter or the caster.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So the water supply system is not related to this electricity?</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: In any new place I've been to — there has always been a way to get water. And
        few people want to fall into the city just to have a simple <em>skonalization</em>; more often they dig a pit, and
        everything is removed from the house into one pit. Then I dragged it, that with oxygen I dragged.</p>

</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I have an uncle, for example, he has a special relationship with the city. He built himself a house
        so that the power plant pays him money every month for giving energy back to the grid. There are solar panels,
        a small fan, he even dug himself a tunnel underground for a thermodynamic turbine.</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes, someone good! I'm a salonist too with a quoted one. And the dream with her already brings cedar drus;
        cedar and the ground — you haven't hit yet. Mm... actually the end.
        Draw here. Right in the summer with attitlifem. In Romania, I Inv Pho. Pure saturation... Oh! Just по трагамер
        делку. Cool books! And in general, very
        cool dude [<i>Mihai Brabaneșcu</i>]. I was blown away; there everything was just sapalo. So, everything started with my little girlfriend
        — a transushka in Lada — who initially lived for a long time in the Netherlands. And she hinted me my primary steps in Amsterdam: what you need to do is come to Kabia and in Kabia
        look for a transushka in Lada. There really is the first... as he gave me the mazic thanks to... they opened up! In short,
        otherwise
        Mihai comes to us; I also wrote him into the same place where I was myself. The transushkas owned him, he understands that this
        is the only place where he was the only time in
        silence 5 years ago. He made a fuss, acid, and threw chairs out the window. Then he had a book presentation,
        which a person came to, who, in fact, was the owner of this place. They
        made some kind of reconciliation. Mihai explained to him that he was a native there and all that. Please
        forgive me for this curiosity as a viewer.</p>

    <p>There’s a cool photo: exactly at the moment when I passed in a set in games without a dirty handover of keys to Mikhail
        [Mihai]. Someone photographed us — some builders. Bombastic nonsense! But just you... Some teacher from a printer
        climbed out, in short. Not a Moldovan! I was also asked about something in Moldova. Unlike this loaded one with the most managed Europe, there is
        one “gaza” [<i>Tomato Gose - a unique Russian beer with vegetables</i>]. That is, it’s almost not in “gaza”. That’s it... Well, a newspaper for beer, like oh... I’ve already been in Russia for years, spread out. And I just wish
        an incredible thing and I
        am amazed.</p>

    <p>I am Amazed. </p>

    <p>I believe that these are the Netherlands [Niderlandy] and tomato gose should be connected from childhood. Here are three people — this is
        some kind of foodie and
        a business idea because “gaza” is an idea to take from the line. Here’s also for the company, a dude with Alty, a fat dude with
        Alty. That’s it. Here’s also from what
        I cursed everything. It was poor here. Good “gazaya”, hop-hat-brewery, and in Ukraine everything is “rustremy”. A bottle, with
        “rustrem”, tomato
        kuza, I dream of all this.
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>:
        And tomatoes, where are they grown here?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>:
        On solar panels. On solar panels. On solar panels. On solar panels. On solar panels.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So, okay...
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: well you know, при дистрове здесь знаешь малдол... </p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Let's move on. Romania. This... What is it even? What are the impressions?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: travelblog now, right? We are not very complicated; it's just that I was there Prokrasci and in general here.
        I would like to see Puharest once, but Puharest did not leave me with a good impression. I think,
        that it's more of a hole; but there actually are some topics about the view.</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I also don't feel much difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Oh, how is it? No, I think it will be a sigans. It's like a tabora and dances - what we
        see. I really like everything around the circle-poki and all sorts of
        small villages. It's not very difficult to promote. Here's a stupid example, one day - what about the krumuni? We go to different
        places that we want to see with my friends: igram and rumuns. And it means that with the baby... who is 3
        months old due to his mother's relationship with
        what in him... At the moment, it turns out that it doesn't correspond to the program of our desires. And the guys
        realize that my program is mainly to expand somehow - and this is impossible to do
        with a baby. Accordingly, I'm good with it. I just get out, and here is a garnolyl resort,
        a huge dog, such an <em>allobai</em>. Approaches me, and I say to him: "Hello, hello! I'm fine. I'll find you about
        here and in the north. This is <em>game-kva-del</em>, and you and I have a 20-hour hellish kaip through 20 times one by one in
        another place — once nakhti of abandoned mines, zhulkers on the mountains and with other things under the konsovka. This is these winter, that is
        there... But sometimes you squeeze out for sure that in Robbo such, then they are higher for you than calm. But I am in
    beyders for economy. This is easy, but you with drink and in LON, and you can taste like with vorkh. Mostly, that in
    some moment we are completely fiercely cold. Naturally, no one has transport communication with nothing. Cars do not accumulate and
    cool dudes — rumurintsy, pityuki, whom I met for right.</p>

    <p>We just take you where you need. In the course of their initial plans were generally the opposite: I’ll throw off the car — that’s it! Don hotel,
        where
        my friends settled — half an hour and dizdy. We chat awesomely on different topics while driving. And at some
        moment I also say something about cops. Hateful! I show so that they are all cops. But the guys are paying —
        which is surprising! If you compare with Pridnestrovian or Kazakhstani for Rukhoy — here how could you bring it
        missed. The fattest!
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: What places have been visited?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes, everything you want has been — we want to ask! They told me about one word here —
        tonnelit... So I got to know one dream — I tonnelit! Sumna has its own experiment. Here or,
        replies? I have a girlfriend who writes to me that she
        is a professional in caves. And she led the tunnel, in short, just cars through the mountain. And she wrote: "How I love
        caves". What now is under question at all, what she understands.</p>

    <p>In general, I wanted to leave when from Gorselexperienz it was somewhere, something I better, somehow there. And more to
        there, something on <em>grofomalenkoye</em>. Something like that, you lick and remove all the handunia. Here's this snob in

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: So there is a snake, a skull, a hip and a head — well or something like that. But the story, everywhere different;

        although film products are not-vegan, because still are used gelatin containing products for
        projections. That is, photos, under which I often get — not by running. Why am I apologizing to you
        lordgodmy?
    <p><em>Ye</em>[<i>Kanye West</i>] — gave a very good interview. He gave to Ku Klux Klan in black outfit recently.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong> Kanye West gave interview to Ku Klux Klan?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: He just gave an interview to some random guy, who was very happy because he could ask him all his questions. But he couldn't ask a single question, because Yan just talked for an hour about his family. He was wearing a Ku Klux Klan hat, but it wasn't white, it was black.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Relatable. Let's go further, so as not to stop. I will endure. I will not go piss.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes, we will show through this. I wanted... These were their... interesting slabs B Liverpool In
        keintherpe. I am arrays; I already
        consu origins from Triecture like this.</p>

    <p>
        There is a feeling as if these are invited guests who look at our scandab.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Yes-yes!</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: When you are located footballs — we just walk yes! Health giblishaya. I want to make <em>oblimos</em> for the rights of the world, because back to trukha many times. Watch
        Dayton, and what is it through English, <em>trukha</em>...
</div>

<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: <em>trukha</em>? </p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Yes, trukha</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Trukha today is what?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: That from which, that... maximally not alive and unreal. That, which as an answer can
        be used — this is my kind of attempt to understand on a happy
        selfin. He met still in ancient times; there were people who photographed exclusively some selfin. And at
        the remarkable publishing house Infinity Press recently came out... incredibly strong pattural perbersion, which lives
        in trage somewhere on the territory
        of Britain. All his photography and everything is connected only with himself. That is, he puts a tripod and photographs himself. This
        very much conveys some kind of vitality of the process. Here to all the so-called bomgua photography.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: just like moving pictures, like paik, who talks about the honesty of what we feel.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: it seems to me that this is already a bit irrelevant. and it doesn't work from oneself; it rather works only for oneself. there is a certain schizophrenic quality in it. in everything i say — more schizophasia. and that's why on video... i put on demka, kukul, strankl and pake an amazing person from the city... damn... igor govman from kantak and tuchka ros. he has a channel on youtube; there is a wonderful discussion there about russian and punishment — something about lami...</p>

    <p>the first voluminous city. </p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I was in Kherson. </p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
 <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: I was only in Kiev. I can't throw myself in to continue these
 psychotherapy sessions of our
 interview. My day in Kiev, what does it look like? So you wake up early in the morning and you wake up in an apartment,
 where...
        are now writing denunciations about you, that you're Russian and you should die.</p> <p>He's just an anti-fascist.

    <p>At that point, he's just an anti-fanatic spokesman, and you explain to him that you're going to visit the most
 right-wing of Kivalya Ukraine in the evening. And he says, "That's fine," because a lot of his colleagues also go there
 to listen to
 <em>black vitriol</em>.
    </p>


    <p>You understand that everything is fine; </p>

    <p>I highly suggest that all podcast readers pay close attention to this interview with a surname from pesnoir, telling
 about
 the delights of France and my authoress's hatred of France. The lines and mujina we discussed today
 and fucked up French assholes have nothing
 to do with the fact that actually something everywhere can always be <em>good</em>. And familiars are very much
 telling the front of a certain redneck way of life, when in some small
 town there is some completely parallel <em>France</em>. Unfamiliar to the average person who is ustret
 near
 the Paris Tower. Something called. There's Damdy Paris. Noter Damdy Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
 <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Let it be Noterdam de Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
 <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Okay, it will be Noter Damdy Paris. Any, I had it there. Well, it's the same. Well, not an Elgusian tower. But some Notre Dame Paris. No, which one?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
 <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: The Eiffel Tower.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
 <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Eiffel? Yes. Barizheis, the elven tower.
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Well, in my opinion, Eiffel, ayfol-tallor.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Ah, ayfol, ayfol! That's it, I accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: I was also confused for a second. I really like how you are conducting this interview. I'm even
        interested in where you will lead it next?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: I apologize for the fact that I am conducting it because I feel like I am in the forest to my own
        aircentism. And I feel like this on ACK crossrage consport. I will not use... I don't remember... I wanted
        to use the expression of sick-mochey from the Heniku group... But this word flew away to the north; it faces
        creates support because your
        fluids say that I'm doing the right thing and it encourages me more to kindle.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Chuver to pugle, let's say... what did you expect, Leonid?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: Let's be pischurat! You are interesting to the rainbow and you put me! I was filming the second
        clip, specially ordered a positive attachment for the GoPro 360 camera.
        When I ordered it, I didn't know that renting it for one day costs as much as buying it. It was a big
        mistake. What was the task of this attachment?</p>
    <p>I Performed in the City of Tula, If I Remember Correctly.  </p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Yes, of course. How did the city accept you?</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: The combat task was some dunes close to the city of Tulla, where he was filmed as a common array for the
        second clip. It is interesting how the story about why I touch my head like this - more precisely, not why, but how it
        happens and what it means to me. I asked for attention to the fact that when I record an answer to someone's
        questions... And what if it wasn't here yet? I must bring my right hand to my
        the back of my head, including the roof. And at some point, realizing that I constantly use this technique - apparently leading me away from some kind of
        nervous tension - I began to circle my hand around my head.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Pyotr</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
    <p><strong>Leonid</strong>: And it is noticeable from the hairstyle that there is a little no hair on the top of the head. This is some kind of phenomenon. I
        used
        this when we performed in Paris; me and another sritsya. I used glue that I was sure I could
        wash off easily with water. About
        <em>Pontagon gem</em> there was a situation in Berlin. When I used ladox glue on my eyes, I thought it was impossible to remove it, and partially cut off my hair on my head. Later I learned that it can be easily removed with warm
        water.
        So it happened, that's why not so many hairs were lost.
    </p>

    <p>But then, when I Performed in a Pair with Another Person, and then in a setting with a client, i noted that I Had Another Latex on My Hair - This Time Transparent. </p>

    <p>This is a Moment to go work on the text. </p>
