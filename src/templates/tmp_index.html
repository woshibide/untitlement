        <h1>This page presents three interconnected texts, all gathered under the emerging notion of untitlement. A term not yet coined in full, untitlement gestures toward the gray zone between “Untitled” and “Disentitlement,” pointing to the differing ways in which humans and machines relate to language. Readers are invited to explore this distinction over the course of approximately one hour and thirteen minutes. The first two parts bring the spotlight onto the last hope of russian underground—Leonid Kotelnikov, also known as Fake Trailers, offering him space to speak freely and at length. Please note that first two sections are in Russian, and that the second part of the interview intensifies intentionally. Should the reader lack knowledge of Russian, they may proceed directly to the <a href="#third-issue">third issue</a></h1>
        <p>TL;DR? Just close this page.</p>

        <h2>Issue 1: interview</h2>
        <h3>The reader should be aware of the interview’s setting: it took place on a Sunday late afternoon  after Rewire Festival, in a typical sports bar — the kind one might find in any European city center — where four people gathered to say their goodbyes and, at the same time, interview Leonid. The conversation was recorded on a phone, with a football match playing above us on TV, and as the evening progressed and the consumed alcohol per visitor increased, so did the noise of its patrons. That atmosphere — the unfiltered soundscape of voices, languages, and distractions — is fully present in the audio. And the text? The recording was later given to state-of-the-art transcription tools, which struggled to separate speech from noise, especially given the bar’s international crowd. Machines attempts produced mostly gibberish, which was then handed over to the latest AI models to extract meaning — a task at which they successfully failed. And yet, Leonid’s voice, thoughts, and sense persist. An effort towards meaning is added via [...] by the interviewer, but careful reader will not even need these clarifications. Topics discussed include his recent journey through the Balkans, beginning with a pregnant dog near a Transnistrian mineshaft, then following the Danube into Romania. From there, the conversation drifts into photography and his time with Mihai Barabancea, eventually leading to reflections on contemporary photography, music, and literature. Enjoy the read.</h3>
